        <div><p>The Statue of Zeus is a monument in a temple within the Sanctuary of Olympia, located in and administered by the city of Elis, known as the birthplace of the Olympic Games. The city's protector god was Zeus, so the statue was built with the idea of paying homage to him and the Olympic Games were held every four years. 
            In the 5th century BC, the famous sculptor Phidias, the same one who made the statue of Athena in Athens, was commissioned by the city of Olympia to produce a statue in honor of Zeus. The statue was made entirely of ivory and ebony, the eyes were precious stones and the sculpture sat on a throne made entirely of cedar, gold, ivory and ebony. In one hand it held a statuette of Nike, the goddess of victory, and in the other it held a scepter with water on top. 
            The sculpture no longer exists today, and historians don't know for sure what happened to cause the destruction of this historical monument, but there are several theories that try to explain the situation. In one of them, researchers came to the conclusion that the end of the Temple of Zeus in Olympia occurred after a series of earthquakes, between 522 AD and 551 AD, which devastated the ruins and buried part of the building. The site was thus destroyed by an "act of the gods".
