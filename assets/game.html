        <div><h2>How many people can play?</h2></div>
         <div><p>From 2 to 10 players</p></div>
        <h2>Game Deck:</h2>
        <div><p>Number cards: numbers 0 to 9 in four colors (gold, ruby, diamond, and emerald), with two copies of each number and color</p></div>
        <div><p>Special cards: skip, reverse, minus two, change color, and minus four</p></div>
        <div><p>Themed cards: Sandals of Hermes (steal card), Statue (block), Divine Favor (plus four cards), and Athena's Strategy</p></div>
        <h2>How to Play?</h2>
        <div><p>- Distribution: Shuffle the cards and deal 7 cards to each player. Place the remaining cards face down as the draw pile and turn the top card over to start the discard pile.</p></div>
        <div><p>Order of Play: The game proceeds clockwise. In each turn, a player must play a card that matches the color or number of the card on top of the discard pile or play a special card.</p></div>
        <h2>Game Objective:</h2>
        <div><p>The objective is to win as many cards as possible throughout the game. Instead of discarding your cards, focus on acquiring them until the pile runs out and/or from opponents' hands using special cards.</p></div>
        <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
        <div><p>The game does not have a traditional winner. Instead, the goal is to accumulate as many cards as possible. The game can be played for several rounds, and at the end of each round, the player with the most cards in hand is the winner of that round.</p></div>
        <h2>Tie in the Game:</h2>
        <div><p>In case of a tie, the players who obtained the same number of cards must sum according to the summation card</p></div>
        <h2>Summation Card</h2>
        <div><p>Cards from 0 to 9 are worth their own value.</p></div>
        <div><p>Skip, reverse, minus two, change color, and minus four cards are worth 10 points.</p></div>
        <div><p>Sandals of Hermes, Divine Favor, and Athena's Strategy are worth 20 points.</p></div>
        <div><p>Statue of Zeus is worth 50 points.</p></div>
        <h2>Additional Rules</h2>
        <div><p>Change of Direction: Some special cards can change the direction of the game.</p></div>
        <div><p>Rounds: The game can be played in multiple rounds. At the end of each round, count the number of cards each player has to determine the winner.</p></div>
        <h2>Special Cards</h2>
        <div><p>Sandals of Hermes (Steal Card): When played, choose a player to pick 2 cards from the draw pile and add these cards to your hand.</p></div>
        <div><p>Statue (Block): When played, the next player loses their turn, and you can draw 1 card from the draw pile as a reward.</p></div>
        <div><p>Divine Favor: When you play this card, you must draw 4 additional cards from the draw pile and add them to your hand.</p></div>
        <div><p>Athena's Strategy: When you play this card, look at the top three cards of the draw pile and choose one to keep. Put the other two back on the draw pile in any order and add the chosen card to your hand.</p></div>
        <h2>Strategies</h2>
        <div><p>Use the Sandals of Hermes to increase your card pile by making other players draw more cards.</p></div>
        <div><p>Play the Statue to block an opponent and gain an additional card as a reward.</p></div>
        <div><p>Take advantage of Divine Favor to get a significant amount of cards and quickly increase your count.</p></div>
        <div><p>Use Athena's Strategy to give yourself three cards to choose from and increase your advantage in the game.</p></div>
        <div><p>With these rules, you can have fun competing to accumulate as many cards as possible, putting an interesting twist on the classic Uno Reverse!</p></div>
